# The Basic Calc (With Extra Sass) 🦢

A persistent, interactive CLI calculator built in Python. This was my first project focusing on data persistence and user-centric design.

## 🚀 Features
- Sassy Feedback: Randomized roasts and loading messages that react to your math choices.
- Data Persistence: Automatically logs all calculations to a local `shame_log.txt` file.
- Midterm Stress Predictor: A reality-check tool for Waterloo students based on stress levels.
- Easter Eggs: Secret commands triggered by specific operator inputs.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python File I/O: Implementing both reading (`r`) and appending (`a`) modes for data management.
- Logic & Branching: Using complex `if/elif/else` structures and randomized dictionaries.
- State Management: Features a session-based history list and a "History Purge" command to manage local data.
- Error Handling: Robust `try/except` blocks to manage input validation and edge cases.
- Version Control: Managing a professional GitHub workflow with `.gitignore` for data privacy.
